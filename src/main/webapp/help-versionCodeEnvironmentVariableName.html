		For Android builds - The version code will be stored in the environment variable specified here.
	</p>
	<p>
	    An integer value that represents the version of the application code, relative to other versions.
		<br /><br />
	    The value is an integer so that other applications can programmatically evaluate it, 
		for example to check an upgrade or downgrade relationship. You can set the value to any integer you want, 
		however you should make sure that each successive release of your application uses a greater value. 
		The system does not enforce this behavior, but increasing the value with successive releases is normative.
